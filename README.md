# Digital_Car_Parking-System
a digital car parking system programmed entirely in VHDL coding in Quartus Prime

This project utlizes the VHDL programming language in order to create a digital car parking system it has several features such as:-
1. Track how many cars currently parked
2. Update everytime a car leaves or enters the car park
3. Detect when a car is present at the entrance
4. Prevent entry when any authentication method curretly implemented fails

A waveform file is used to simulate the system's behaviour in order to confirm its functionalities
